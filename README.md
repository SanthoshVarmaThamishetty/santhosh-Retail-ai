🛒 Retail AI Agent – End-to-End Agentic ML System

An AI-powered Retail Recommendation Agent built with modern Machine Learning, NLP, and microservice architecture principles.
The system uses semantic search + embeddings + LLM orchestration to provide intelligent product recommendations from structured retail datasets.

This project demonstrates production-grade ML engineering practices including agent-based reasoning, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), FastAPI microservices, vector search, and MLOps-ready design.
